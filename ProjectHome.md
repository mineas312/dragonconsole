# This project is now hosted on Github #

[The new Github repo](http://www.github.com/bbuck/dragonconsole)

Despite it's long and successful past on GoogleCode this project has been ported to Github (where I host other projects I'm working on now). Other than Repo changes (the Google code has been changed from SVN to Git, sorry for any issues this may cause) nothing else with the project will change. I'm porting any issues to Github and will do all future updates there and occasionally push back here. I'll drop this Repo completely at undecided date in the future.

# DragonConsole 3 beta is here!  #

DragonConsole v3.0.0 beta is finally finished and available for checkout (via this GoogleCode Project) or you can download the 3.0.0 JAR or Source File ZIP in the Downloads section. Version 3 is the first to be released as an Open Source project and is a lightweight and useful Terminal Emulator for any Java application designed for any Operation System (with a JVM).

## DragonConsole v3 Features ##

  * The ability to Color Text that is output to the Console with simple three character DragonConsole Color Codes (DCCC).
  * A CommandProcessor to process all input given by the user.
  * Two methods of input. Inline, which allows the user to type directly in the Console (for a Console look and feel) or Separated input which uses an "Input Area" at the bottom of the Console for input.
  * FileProcessor for quick and easy reading of a plain text file and converting it into a String.
  * InputScript which allows the programmer to script input methods directly into Output sent to the console. There are four different types of input, Ranged, Protected Ranged, Infinite, and Protected Infinite.
  * ANSI Color Code support (must be enabled/disabled) with more ANSI Code Support on the way!
