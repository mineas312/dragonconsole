# Introduction #

DCScript, short for DragonConsole Script, are small snippets of commands for the Console to process to give the programmer implementing the console a certain level of control on how text is to be displayed or controlled. Anything that DCScript will do is designed to mimic that of Console controls that are present in new and older console applications to make `DragonConsole` feel more like an official Console.

DCScript is a new concept and idea that will be initially added into the Beta version of 3.0.0 and will grow and change as new ideas are added or found. Anything here is subject to change or become obsolete in the future.

## Current Plans for DCScript ##

InputScript is the only portion of DCScript that will present in the initial release of 3.0.0.

**Plans for Future DCScripts**
  * UpdateScript - Allows the programmer to specify a range of character (and name it) so that it can be changed or updated. Examples would be like a progress bar that grows as files are downloaded from a server.
  * ConditionalScript - Script that will function as an if else that can be placed within a String passed through append.
  * ColorScript - Small piece of script that will allow the programmer to specify a foreground/background color for a portion of text without having to add the color to the console permanently.
  * KeyScript - This will allow Keyboard input to move between objects in the console so that the user can move between choices that are displayed as text with the arrow keys.
