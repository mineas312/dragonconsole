&XbDragon&xbConsole &xbsupports color output, and to create the rich output is extremely
simple! When you &dbappend &xba String to the console it will process the String for
any color codes and add the String to the document with the proper styles for
each section.

Let's color a prompt! We'll use &wb"&xbprompt@example> &wb" &xband without color you see:

&xbprompt@example>

&xbWhich can be kind of boring, but with color we can change that. We'll use the
new prompt with color codes &wb"&xb&&rbprompt&&wb@&&Gbexample&&cb> &wb" &xbto get:

&rbprompt&wb@&Gbexample&cb>

&xbWhich is now much easier to denote each separate portion and it pops off the
screen. Are the colors required, of course not, but they make everything look
better if used appropriately.

So, how exactly do you create a proper color code? Well lets see, a color code
consists of a color code character, a foreground character, and background
character.

&wb&&FB

&xbThe &wb"&&"&xb is the default color code character (can be changed with
&dbsetColorCodeChar(char)&xb) the &wb"F"&xb is the Foreground color character
and the &wb"B"&xb is the Background color character. By default there are a
number of colors added to the console and you can add anymore that you want
with &dbaddTextColor(char, Color)&xb.
